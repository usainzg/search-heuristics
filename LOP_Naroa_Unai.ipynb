In this problem, we are given a matrix $B = [b_{ij}]_{i,j=1,...,n}$ of non-negative numbers. The objective in this problem is to find the joint permutation $\\sigma = (\\sigma(1)\\sigma(2)...\\sigma(n))$ of rows and columns that maximises the sum of the numbers above the main diagonal of the matrix.\n","\n","#### Data\n","The data given to solve the problem is a matrix $B = [b_{ij}]_{i,j=1,...,n}$ of non-negative numbers, where \n","$n$ is equal to the number of rows and columns of the matrix.\n","\n","#### Possible solution\n","A permutation $\\sigma = (\\sigma(1)\\sigma(2)...\\sigma(n))$ would be a possible solution of the problem.\n","\n","#### Search space\n","The search space is all the possible different permutations of size $n$. The size of this search space is $\\Omega = n!$\n","\n","#### Objective function\n","Given a permutation, the objective function is written as follows:  $f(\\sigma)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\\sum_{j=i+1}^n b_{\\sigma(i)\\sigma(j)}$\n","\n","#### Table of Contents\n","TODO!\n","First of all, we have written a function that reads an instance of the LOP problem. Then, we have implemented the objective function and another function that calculates the fitness value of a neighbour.
